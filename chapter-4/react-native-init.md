# react-native init

To create a local React Native project in your computer, we're going to use a command-line interface called `react-native`, you can install it with:

```
npm install --global react-native-cli
```

Then, `cd` into a folder of your choice and create your project:

```
react-native init MyProject
```

(You can choose any name to replace `MyProject`, but keep it one word, or camel case)

This will begin installing some libraries that React Native needs, and it will create a template project with everything set up for us to begin coding. Once the `init` is done, go into the project folder with `cd MyProject`.
