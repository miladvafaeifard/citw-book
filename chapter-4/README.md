# Wednesday A

In this session we are going to drop Expo, and instead, compile and run a dedicated app (with its own app name) for our project. This will require us to use Xcode or Android Studio (just a bit), but most of the time we will still be using JavaScript and React Native. In this process, we will learn about common errors, how to debug, and some troubleshooting tips.
