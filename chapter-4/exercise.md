# Exercise

In this exercise, get your favorite Expo example or exercise from yesterday and bring it into your local React Native project. Make sure it compiles and builds correctly, and can be used correctly.

Start warming up for your demo idea, do you already know what you want to build? In the next session we will get some final skills to build the whole thing. If you have extra time, start building it already. Check the list of [open APIs](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis) and see if you can easily make requests with `fetch`.
