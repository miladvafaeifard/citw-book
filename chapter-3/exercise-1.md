# Exercise

In this exercise, the goal is to display:

- A text input field
- A button: "Submit"
- A text label

Where the submit button will add the contents of the text input field to an array, and the text label will show all the words submitted so far. Every time the submit button is pressed, the text input is also cleared.

See [this short video](./exercise-input.mp4) to understand the expected outcome.
