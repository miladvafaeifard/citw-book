# Intro

**Welcome to Code in the Woods _Autumn 2018_** brought to you by Barona Technologies, Forenom, and Andre Staltz!

This year we will learn how to build mobile apps for iOS or Android using React Native and JavaScript.

This booklet contains basic course material for all days during the camp, so you can follow at your own pace and not miss any important information. Feel free to make any questions to the teacher or the mentors at any point. :)
