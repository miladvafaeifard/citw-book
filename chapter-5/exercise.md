# Exercise

Now is your turn! Let's build something real with React Native. Pick an [open data backend](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis), invent a nice idea, then build a simple app that uses that data. As a reference, check the [source code for the Recipe Explorer app](https://github.com/staltz/citw-demo).

As a tip, most apps have:

- List screen: shows all the data from the server in an "infinitely scrolling" list
- Details screen: once the user presses an item on the list, it opens a details screen with more data on that item
- Something else?

But remember, if you have a different idea that doesn't fit this pattern, please feel free to do whatever you want! The best thing that could happen in this camp is that you end up with a real app that you could use in your daily life, so think about your own needs, or think about your friends' needs.

Feel free to ask the mentors for any help, either in code or feasibility or ideation. Have fun!
