# `<View>`

React Native comes with a dozen built-in components that you can easily import.

The `View` component is the most important one in React Native, it essentially represents a *portion of the screen*, and typically all other components need to use View. It is comparable to `<div>` on the web.

View has several props, but most of them are rarely used, except one: `style`. We will learn more about the `style` prop soon.
