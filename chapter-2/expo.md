# Expo

Expo is a development environment that only requires a browser and a phone. It is easy to get started, and we will use it to learn the basics of React Native without getting into other kinds of compilation troubles.

If you haven't yet, read the [Software installation guide](../chapter-1/software.md) to learn how to use Expo.
